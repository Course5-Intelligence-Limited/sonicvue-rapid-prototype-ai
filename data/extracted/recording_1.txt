Start Time: 180.50
End Time: 197.85
Customer: Yes.
Start Time: 198.59
End Time: 199.38
Agent: Hi, Priya. Pardon? All right. So.
Start Time: 200.47
End Time: 204.66

End Time: 209.38

Start Time: 212.28
End Time: 215.22
Customer: Yes, I can hear you better now.
Start Time: 217.28
End Time: 219.34

Start Time: 220.65

Start Time: 259.93
End Time: 268.11
Customer: Yeah. All right. I see data transfer. What should I do next?
Start Time: 269.77
End Time: 276.04

Start Time: 277.42
End Time: 285.68
Customer: Got it. It wasn't checked. I have selected it now.
Start Time: 289.01
End Time: 292.68

Start Time: 293.99
End Time: 302.88
